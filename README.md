# solar_system-with-turtle-module

This repository contains a Python script for visualizing the solar system. It provides a graphical representation of the planets and their orbits using the matplotlib library. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the relative sizes and positions of celestial bodies within our solar system.

Features
Visualize the solar system with accurate proportions of planet sizes and distances.
Interactive 3D visualization that allows zooming and rotation.
Display basic information about each planet on mouse hover.
Customize the appearance of the planets, orbits, and background.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Solar System Visualization with Python
This repository contains a Python script for visualizing the solar system. It provides a graphical representation of the planets and their orbits using the turtle and math modules. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the relative sizes and positions of celestial bodies within our solar system.

Features
Visualize the solar system with accurate proportions of planet sizes and distances.
Interactive 2D visualization that allows zooming and panning.
Display basic information about each planet on mouse hover.
Customize the appearance of the planets, orbits, and background.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system-visualization.git
Install the required dependencies:
shell
Copy code
pip install turtle
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:
shell
Copy code
cd solar-system-visualization
Run the Python script:
shell
Copy code
python solar_system_visualization.py
The solar system visualization window will open, displaying the planets and their orbits.

You can use the following controls:

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Click and drag to pan the view.
Press the Spacebar to toggle the display of planet information.
Customization
You can customize various aspects of the visualization by modifying the solar_system_visualization.py script:

Change the colors, sizes, and positions of the planets.
Adjust the size and appearance of the orbits.
Modify the background color and texture.
Add additional celestial bodies or remove existing ones.
